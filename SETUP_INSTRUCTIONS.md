## 📋 Next Step: Create Database Tables

To complete the setup and see data in your admin dashboard, you need to create the database tables in Supabase.

### Option 1: Use Supabase MCP Integration (Recommended)

1. [Connect to Supabase](#open-mcp-popover) through the MCP integrations
2. Once connected, use the Supabase MCP tools to create the tables

### Option 2: Manual Setup via Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/project/fqlvwhzkukqonvohhipc)
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the SQL from `setup_supabase_tables.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

## 🧪 Test the Integration

After creating the tables, test the system:

1. **Contact Form**: Go to `/contact` and submit a message
2. **Job Application**: Go to `/careers` and apply for a job
3. **Get Started**: Go to `/get-started` and submit a request
4. **Newsletter**: Go to `/blogs` and subscribe to the newsletter
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Go to `/admin` (password: admin2024) to see all data

## 📊 Expected Results

Once the tables are created and you submit some test forms, your admin dashboard will show:

- Real-time statistics from Supabase
- Form submissions in organized tables
- Google Sheets synchronization (if configured)
- Resume file uploads with download links

## 🔍 Verification

You can verify the connection is working by:

1. Checking the browser console for any Supabase connection errors
2. Submitting a test form and checking if data appears in Supabase
3. Viewing the admin dashboard for populated statistics

Your integration is now complete and ready to use!
