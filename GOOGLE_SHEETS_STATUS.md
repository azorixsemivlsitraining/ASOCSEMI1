# Google Sheets Integration Status

## ✅ Configuration Complete

Your Google Sheets integration has been successfully configured with:

- **Spreadsheet ID**: `1D5lzYxK5BR-7Dszy6VpxpvPBUSKiyC2kSDCic6ktTl8`
- **API Key**: `AIzaSyDUwW6iQSE62hA32jwHxmf0IS1Yo33Jods`
- **Spreadsheet Title**: "ASOCSEMI"

## 📊 Available Sheets

The following sheets are configured and ready:

- ✅ **Contacts** - For contact form submissions
- ✅ **Job Applications** - For job application forms

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### Read Access ✅

- API can successfully read data from your spreadsheet
- Integration widget will show as "configured"
- Can verify spreadsheet exists and sheets are properly named

### Write Access ❌

- **Issue**: Google Sheets API requires OAuth2 authentication for write operations
- **Current Setup**: API Key only provides read-only access
- **Impact**: Form submissions won't automatically sync to Google Sheets

## 🔧 Solutions for Write Access

### Option 1: Continue with Read-Only (Recommended for now)

- Keep current setup for monitoring purposes
- Forms still save to Supabase database
- Admin dashboard shows all data
- Google Sheets integration shows as configured

### Option 2: Enable Full Sync (Advanced Setup Required)

To enable automatic form submission sync to Google Sheets, you would need:

1. **Service Account Setup** (Recommended):

   - Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
   - Download service account JSON key
   - Share spreadsheet with service account email
   - Update environment variables with service account credentials

2. **OAuth2 Setup** (More Complex):
   - Configure OAuth2 flow for web application
   - Handle user authentication
   - Store refresh tokens securely

## 📈 Current Status

- ✅ Google Sheets widget shows as configured
- ✅ Can open spreadsheet directly from admin dashboard
- ✅ All form data is stored in Supabase
- ⚠️ Background sync is disabled (read-only API key)
- ✅ All forms work normally and save data

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the integration**: Check admin dashboard to see Google Sheets widget
2. **Verify spreadsheet**: Click "Open Sheets" button to view your spreadsheet
3. **Optional**: Set up service account for write access if needed

## 📝 Notes

- The integration is functional for monitoring purposes
- All form functionality remains unchanged
- Data is securely stored in Supabase regardless of Google Sheets sync status
- Users won't notice any difference in form submission experience
